## Abstract

Recent advances in radiance field reconstruction, such as 3D Gaussian splatting, enable real-time rendering with high visual fidelity on powerful graphics hardware. However, efficient online transmission and rendering across diverse platforms requires drastic model simplification. DiffSoup represents radiance fields as a soup (i.e., a highly unstructured set) of a small number of triangles with neural textures and binary opacity. We show that this binary opacity is directly differentiable via stochastic opacity masking, enabling stable training without smooth rasterization. DiffSoup can be rasterized using standard depth testing, enabling seamless integration into traditional graphics pipelines and interactive rendering on consumer-grade laptops and mobile devices.

## Tested Environment

- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- Python 3.11
- CUDA 13.0
- RTX 4070 Ti SUPER

## Installation

Clone this repository and create a virtual environment:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/kenji-tojo/diffsoup.git
cd diffsoup
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install PyTorch with CUDA 12.4 from the [official website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/):

```bash
pip3 install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124
```

Build and install the `diffsoup` module:

```bash
pip3 install -v .
```

Install the remaining dependencies:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Build and install the fused SSIM extension:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
pip3 install --no-build-isolation ./submodules/fused-ssim
```

The training scripts use `fused_ssim` automatically when it is importable and
fall back to `pytorch_msssim` otherwise. There is no runtime backend flag. On
Windows, run the extension build from an x64 Visual Studio developer prompt so
`cl.exe` is available.

## Datasets

### Multi-View Datasets

Download the following datasets from their official websites and extract them under `./datasets/`:

| Dataset | Directory |
|---|---|
| [MipNeRF-360](https://jonbarron.info/mipnerf360/) | `datasets/360_v2/` |
| [NeRF-Synthetic](https://www.matthewtancik.com/nerf) | `datasets/nerf_synthetic/` |
| [Shelly](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/toronto-ai/adaptive-shells/) | `datasets/shelly_data_release/` |

### MobileNeRF Meshes (for Initialization)

To reproduce our experiments, we provide the MobileNeRF meshes used in the paper: [**Download (Google Drive)**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sTC2dMjICuNf3KlAUyCEltQH5TLqKqFH/view?usp=sharing)

Extract the archive under `datasets/`. Each scene contains the original mesh (`shape.obj`) and a decimated version (`shape_15K.obj`) produced with MeshLab. These meshes are used as initialization in `examples/02_synthetic.py`.

> **Note:** If you want to perform a new comparison against MobileNeRF, you should re-run their method yourself to ensure a fair comparison. The provided meshes are only meant to reproduce the experiments in our paper. For initialization with further reduced face counts, you can apply MeshLab's Quadric Edge Collapse Decimation to the original `shape.obj` (e.g. to produce `shape_5K.obj`).

### Pre-Computed Results (for Mobile Benchmark)

We provide our pre-computed results for all models on NeRF-Synthetic and Shelly: [**Download (Google Drive)**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rAElfG4vlAR9t1rX6QTt3GgZp0T5qOz2/view?usp=sharing)

Extract the archive under `web/data/`. These are required to run the [Mobile Benchmark](#mobile-benchmark).

## Getting Started

### Training

The example scripts in `examples/` cover the main training scenarios:

```bash
# MipNeRF-360 scenes (COLMAP-based, e.g. kitchen, garden, bicycle)
python3 examples/01_mip360.py --scene_root ./datasets/360_v2/kitchen

# NeRF-Synthetic scenes (Blender, e.g. lego, chair, hotdog)
python3 examples/02_synthetic.py --scene lego

# Random initialisation (no MobileNeRF mesh required)
python3 examples/03_random_init.py --scene lego
```

Each script saves a checkpoint (`final_params.pt`), rendered images, and test metrics to its output directory (e.g. `results/01_mip360/kitchen/`).

### Interactive Viewer

View a trained checkpoint with the native OpenGL viewer. The viewer has no CUDA dependency and can be installed on any machine (e.g. a laptop) with OpenGL support:

```bash
pip3 install -v viewer/

python3 examples/04_view_results.py --ckpt results/01_mip360/kitchen/final_params.pt
```

Controls: left-drag to orbit, right-drag to pan, scroll to zoom. The world up direction is auto-detected from the checkpoint (`--up X Y Z` to override).

### FPS Benchmark

Measure rendering throughput across all training and test views:

```bash
# MipNeRF-360
python3 examples/05_benchmark_fps.py \
    --ckpt results/01_mip360/kitchen/final_params.pt \
    --scene_root ./datasets/360_v2/kitchen

# NeRF-Synthetic
python3 examples/05_benchmark_fps.py \
    --ckpt results/02_synthetic/lego/final_params.pt \
    --scene_root ./datasets/nerf_synthetic/lego
```

Results (per-frame timings, mean FPS) are saved to `benchmark_output/` beside the checkpoint.

### Web Viewer

A browser-based viewer is included in `web/`. It runs on any device with WebGL 2 support, including phones.

**Step 1: Export assets**

```bash
# Export one or more checkpoints
python3 examples/06_export_web.py \
    --ckpt results/01_mip360/kitchen/final_params.pt

python3 examples/06_export_web.py \
    --ckpt results/02_synthetic/lego/final_params.pt
```

This writes web-ready files (mesh PLY, LUT PNGs, MLP JSON, metadata) to `web/data/<scene>/` and updates `web/data/models.json`.

**Step 2: Start a local server**

```bash
cd web
python3 -m http.server 8080 --bind 0.0.0.0
```

**Step 3: Open in a browser**

- Desktop: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
- Phone (same network): `http://<your-lan-ip>:8080`

Use the dropdown in the top-left corner to switch between exported scenes. To find your LAN IP, run `hostname -I` on Linux or `ifconfig | grep inet` on macOS.

### Mobile Benchmark

`web/benchmark.html` loads all 14 models onto a grid and runs a deterministic FPS benchmark on a phone using a Fibonacci-lattice camera trajectory. It requires the pre-exported scene data in `web/data/ours_mobile_results/`.

**Step 1: Start a local server on your machine**

```bash
cd web
python3 -m http.server 8080 --bind 0.0.0.0
```

**Step 2: Open on your phone**

Navigate to `http://<your-lan-ip>:8080/benchmark.html` on a phone connected to the same network. To find your LAN IP, run `hostname -I` on Linux or `ifconfig | grep inet` on macOS.

For reproducibility, hold the phone in landscape orientation (width > height) during the benchmark.

Press **Start** to begin. Results (per-pose FPS, camera matrices, screenshots) are exported as a JSON file when the run finishes. To extract human-readable outputs from the JSON:

```bash
python3 examples/07_extract_bench.py \
    --input benchmark_diffsoup_30poses.json
```

This produces `summary.json` (FPS statistics), `summary.csv` (per-pose data), and decoded screenshots in `images/`.
